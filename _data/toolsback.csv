ANCIR works to strengthen African investigative journalism by improving the techniques, expertise, the tools used by its newsroom partners. This includes providing member newsrooms with encryption and semantic analysis technologies, forensic research support (through the Investigative Dashboard), legal services, and seed grants for cross-border collaboration.

ANCIR was part of the global consortium of media partners, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, that carried out the groundbreaking Panama Papers investigation. ANCIR led the coordination of newsrooms in Africa to produce a series of more than 25 articles about the African people and companies named in the leaked materials.

ANCIR receives technical support from Code for Africa.

The system helps them leak these these materials while protecting their own identities, making it difficult to identify the sources of leaked information. This site also allows whistleblowers to stay in touch with reporters and answer further questions without revealing your name or contact information.

afriLEAKS is built on security software created by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights and the open source GlobaLeaks toolkit, using methodologies first pioneered by Publeaks in the Netherlands. afriLEAKS has customized both the technology and deployment models to better suit resource-challenged newsrooms.

It is run by an alliance of African news organizations, including the Mail & Guardian, the Premium Times, the Daily Monitor and the Botswana Guardian.

It is built with investigative reporting as a primary use case, and it allows cross-referencing mentions of well-known people and companies against watch lists, which are built from prior research or public data sets. The tool was first developed for ANCIR, as part of Grano, a reporting tool for investigating the connections between public and private officials.

Following his ICFJ Knight Fellowship, Lindenberg used Aleph to power a data search feature for OCCRP's 
Investigative Dashboard. This investigative tool lets reporters search more than 2.4 million documents and datasets from previous OCCRP investigations as well as official sources and other scraped data. The information is cross-referenced with watchlists based on OCCRP research and international sanctions lists.

The OpenOil platform also leverages Aleph to search through more than 1 million corporate filings related to the oil, gas and mining industries. The site also indexes and makes searchable the full text of contracts, company disclosures, news articles and government reports, enabling reporters to simultaneously check documents from a variety of sources.

After a few days of installation and training, stations can start to facilitate new economic opportunities, new opportunities for expression and deliberation, and provide information across, into, and out of the community they serve.

Each station is amplified by our cloud/telephony Radio as a Service (RaaS). With the cloud, an individual station can receive free voice-quality calls that go straight to air, download audio from the Internet in the background, or run SMS votes. Using any basic phone (through RaaS) local hosts can run live shows with callers; local business people can record ads or announcements; citizen journalists can cover live meetings or sports events. With solar power a station can serve as 24/7 endpoint to emergency services.

Four stations have been running in Northern Uganda for the last year, and small rural communities are creating their own programs, reporting their own news, and requesting audio content from the Internet. RootIO, with the help of Resilient Africa Network, is hoping to launch another 20 stations in the coming year.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/57289128b6aa60d865f57e0f/t/5728933d8259b5e00874ffa5/1465942205438/?format=1500w,8/12/2016 16:11
