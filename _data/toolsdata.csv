African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR),https://investigativecenters.org/,Network of African newsrooms that collaborates on cross-border investigative reporting projects,"The African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) is an association of African investigative newsrooms, ranging from large traditional media to small specialist units.\n\nANCIR works to strengthen African investigative journalism by improving the techniques, expertise, the tools used by its newsroom partners. This includes providing member newsrooms with encryption and semantic analysis technologies, forensic research support (through the Investigative Dashboard), legal services, and seed grants for cross-border collaboration.\n\nANCIR was part of the global consortium of media partners, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, that carried out the groundbreaking Panama Papers investigation. ANCIR led the coordination of newsrooms in Africa to produce a series of more than 25 articles about the African people and companies named in the leaked materials.\n\nANCIR receives technical support from Code for Africa.\n\nFor more: http://bit.ly/28oexss",8/17/2016,"Justin Arenstein,Chris Roper","http://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/justin-arenstein, http://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/chris-roper",How African Journalists Helped Crack the Panama Papers,https://medium.com/code-for-africa/how-african-journalists-helped-crack-the-panama-papers-894ad7843fbf#.votpa2tup,,,https://d3atbsy0flqavg.cloudfront.net/v1.23.0/site/uri/icfjknight-ire2016.silk.co/file/id/f5c0770e-c097-4b71-b849-63bf0bacb6c4/,,Free
afriLEAKS,https://afrileaks.org/,Tool that connects whistleblowers with investigative journalists across Africa.,"afriLEAKS allows whistleblowers to leak confidential documents of public interest. The system helps them leak these these materials while protecting their own identities, making it difficult to identify the sources of leaked information. This site also allows whistleblowers to stay in touch with reporters and answer further questions without revealing your name or contact information.\n\nafriLEAKS is built on security software created by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights and the open source GlobaLeaks toolkit, using methodologies first pioneered by Publeaks in the Netherlands. afriLEAKS has customized both the technology and deployment models to better suit resource-challenged newsrooms.\n\nIt is run by an alliance of African news organizations, including the Mail & Guardian, the Premium Times, the Daily Monitor and the Botswana Guardian.\n\nFor more: http://bit.ly/1tkXkAg",8/17/2016,"Justin Arenstein,Catherine Gicheru,Friedrich Lindenberg","http://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/justin-arenstein, http://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/catherine-gicheru, http://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/friedrich-lindenberg",Wikileaks for Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/13/wikileaks-for-africa-introducing-afrileaks,"ANCIR,Code for Africa","http://icfjknight-ire2016.silk.co/page/ANCIR, https://codeforafrica.org/",https://d3atbsy0flqavg.cloudfront.net/v1.23.0/site/uri/icfjknight-ire2016.silk.co/file/id/083de705-d535-4964-9628-1f57c7fcbac0/,,Free
Aleph,https://github.com/pudo/aleph,Search large datasets for names of people and companies.,"Aleph is a tool, built by Friedrich Lindenberg during his ICFJ Knight Fellowship, for indexing large amounts of both text (PDF, Word, HTML) and tabular (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy browsing and search. It is built with investigative reporting as a primary use case, and it allows cross-referencing mentions of well-known people and companies against watch lists, which are built from prior research or public data sets. The tool was first developed for ANCIR, as part of Grano, a reporting tool for investigating the connections between public and private officials.

Following his ICFJ Knight Fellowship, Lindenberg used Aleph to power a data search feature for OCCRP's 
Investigative Dashboard. This investigative tool lets reporters search more than 2.4 million documents and datasets from previous OCCRP investigations as well as official sources and other scraped data. The information is cross-referenced with watchlists based on OCCRP research and international sanctions lists.

The OpenOil platform also leverages Aleph to search through more than 1 million corporate filings related to the oil, gas and mining industries. The site also indexes and makes searchable the full text of contracts, company disclosures, news articles and government reports, enabling reporters to simultaneously check documents from a variety of sources.
